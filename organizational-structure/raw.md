Committee Position:
Committee Lead (1) for each committee 

in case of department, its going to be same for all the layers, departments can only be created in province and district level when a committee goes in phase 2.1, 

election might happen on different times so each some committee might be in phase 2.0 and some committe might be in phase 2.1

now I want to make database, which is going to have access level defined, organization level defined keeping things flexible, for example, committee might be added, department might be added or removed which is going to remain uniform in all the organization and differerent levels, number of postions in committee might be plus or minus but is going to remain same in all the level, is one province is supposed to have n number of committee members then its going to remain n for all the province 

i need more detailed database/schema/organization/structure/documentation and give me more detailed information esp focused on

how things are going to be handled in future versions, 
how access level are defined, Province Coordinator in phase 2.0 and Province President in phase 2.1 is going to be same, access level needs to be dinfed as phase 2.1 even though postion name is displayed as 2.0,

basically, even though access level is going to be same, in 2.0, only limited positions are available when it comes to 2.1 its more in complete version, let's update database .sql, documentation and data based on this setup
